#Week 11
##Beginner
Problem 6 (anagram) from the <a href="https://github.com/KU-Competitive-Programming/Weekly-Problems/raw/master/CodeRush%202012%20Problems%20and%20Judging%20Data/CodeRush%202012%20Problem%20Set.pdf">CodeRush 2012 problems</a>.

##Advanced
Implement a program that can play the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows">bulls and cows</a> (similar to <em>Mastermind</em> and a mini-game from certain <em>Fallout</em> games). I'll leave it to individual discretion as to whether someone wants their program to be human-controlled or AI-controlled, but if AI is chosen, try to see if the AI can figure out any word within seven turns (<a href="http://bulls-cows.sourceforge.net/bullscows.pdf">because math proved that's possible, yo</a>).
