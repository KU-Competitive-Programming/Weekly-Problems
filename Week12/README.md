# Week 12

## Beginner

Create a code cipher. When given a string of only letters, switch every letter with the letter 13 spots ahead of it. i.e. `a -> n` and `t -> g`. Don't worry about capitalization.

Optional: make the function be able to take a number argument that tells you how far to shift.

Examples:
```
> coding
pbqvat
> CaEsAr
pnrfne
```

## Intermediate

Write a [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) function that contains no assignment. In Java and C++, this is the `=` operator. Given a number n return the nth number in the sequence.

Examples:
```
> fib 1
1
> fib 2
1
> fib 3
2
> fib 4
3
> fib 5
5
```
