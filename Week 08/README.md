# Week 8

### Beginner
(From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort">Wikipedia</a>) You'll be developing a sorting algorithm that doesn't do much actual sorting; that is, every time you rearrange the items in a list, you'll be rearranging them into a <em>random order</em>. If that sounds crazy, it's because it is (think of it like ordering a deck of cards by shuffling it repeatedly). Develop a bogosort algorithm that acts on some list type and test it on increasingly large listsâ€”see how long bogosort takes to slow to a crawl.

### Advanced
(From <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/srp1p/4252012_challenge_44_intermediate/">/r/dailyprogrammer</a>)  Develop a tic-tac-toe robot that will always win or draw, regardless of who goes first. Bonus: allow two tic-tac-toe robots to play each other.
