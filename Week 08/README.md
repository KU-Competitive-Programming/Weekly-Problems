#Week 8
##Beginner
(From <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/1k7s7p/081313_challenge_135_easy_arithmetic_equations/">/r/DailyProgrammer</a>): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a>, the famous multitasking and multi-user operating system, has several standards that defines Unix commands, system calls, subroutines, files, etc. Specifically within <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_7_Unix">Version 7</a> (though this is included in many other Unix standards), there is a game called "arithmetic". To quote the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">Man Page</a>:

> Arithmetic types out simple arithmetic problems, and waits for an answer to be typed in. If the answer is correct, it types back "Right!", and a new problem. If the answer is wrong, it replies "What?", and waits for another answer. Every twenty problems, it publishes statistics on correctness and the time required to answer.

Your goal is to implement this game, with some slight changes, to make this an [Easy]-level challenge. You will only have to use three arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication) with four integers. An example equation you are to generate is <tt>2 x 4 + 2 - 5</tt>.

##Advanced
(From <a href="http://programmingpraxis.com/2013/08/16/monkey-grid-puzzle/">Programming Praxis</a>): There is a monkey which can walk around on a planar grid. The monkey can move one space at a time left, right, up or down. That is, from <tt>(x, y)</tt> the monkey can go to <tt>(x+1, y)</tt>, <tt>(x-1, y)</tt>, <tt>(x, y+1)</tt>, and <tt>(x, y-1)</tt>. Points where the sum of the digits of the absolute value of the x coordinate plus the sum of the digits of the absolute value of the y coordinate are lesser than or equal to 19 are accessible to the monkey. For example, the point <tt>(59, 79)</tt> is inaccessible because <tt>5 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 30</tt>, which is greater than 19. Another example: the point <tt>(-5, -7)</tt> is accessible because <tt>abs(-5) + abs(-7) = 5 + 7 = 12</tt>, which is less than 19. How many points can the monkey access if it starts at <tt>(0, 0)</tt>, including <tt>(0, 0)</tt> itself?

Your task is to write a program that counts the number of available points. When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="http://programmingpraxis.com/2013/08/16/monkey-grid-puzzle/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/68dndvxS">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.
