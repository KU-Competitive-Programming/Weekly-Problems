# Week 12

### Beginner
Construct a maze of a combination of Ws and spaces, utilizing a capital S as the start position, which must be arbitrarily placed, and a capital X as the end as below:<br />

WS  W

WX  W

Write a program from scratch that will read in a maze, find the starting position, and then display using any method you choose, what the shortest route will be and what its length is. If multiple routes are equal in length, display them both and their mutual length.

### Advanced
Implement the same program, but allow for ladders that link multiple levels. Levels stack on one another, with the lowest level being the first declared, and the highest, being the last. Ladders will be indicated with #. To avoid up/down confusion, never put a ladder in the same square connecting two levels as a ladder connecting two other levels.<br />
