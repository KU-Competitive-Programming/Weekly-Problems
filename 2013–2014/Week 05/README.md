#Week 3
##Beginner
(adapted from <a href="http://openbookproject.net/pybiblio/practice/wilson/piglatin.php">here</a>): You are going to create a translation machine for a very specific language: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin">Pig Latin</a>. For example, "Competitive programming" translates to "Ompetitivecay ogrammingpray" in Pig Latin, and "Apples" translates to either "Applesway" or "Applesyay" depending on the dialect of Pig Latin you prefer. Optionally, you can also create a machine that translates from Pig Latin back to English.

##Advanced
(from <a href="http://projecteuler.net/problem=31">Project Euler</a>): In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

    1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p)

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

    1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p

How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
