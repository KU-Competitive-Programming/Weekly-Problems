#Week 3
##Beginner
(From <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/122c4t/10252012_challenge_107_easy_all_possible_decodings/">/r/dailyprogrammer</a>) Consider the translation from letters to numbers <pre>a -> 1</pre> through <pre>z -> 26</pre>. Every sequence of letters can be translated into a string of numbers this way, with the numbers being mushed together. For instance <pre>hello -> 85121215</pre>. Unfortunately the reverse translation is not unique. <pre>85121215</pre> could map to <pre>hello</pre>, but also to <pre>heaubo</pre> Write a program that, given a string of digits, outputs every possible translation back to letters.

Sample input:

<pre>123</pre>

Sample output:

<pre>
abc
aw
lc
</pre>

##Advanced
(From <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/y5t0y/8132012_challenge_88_difficult_ascii_art/">/r/dailyprogrammer</a>) Write a program that given an image file, produces an ASCII-art version of that image. Try it out on <a href"http://i.imgur.com/tJmB9.png">Snoo</a> (note that the background is transparent, not white). There's no requirement that the ASCII-art be particularly good, it only needs to be good enough so that you recognize the original image in there.
