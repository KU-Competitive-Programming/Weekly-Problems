#### General

-   Android - https://developer.android.com/training/index.html

    "Welcome to Training for Android developers. Here you'll find sets of lessons
    within classes that describe how to accomplish a specific task with code samples
    you can re-use in your app. Classes are organized into several groups you can
    see at the top-level of the left navigation.

    This first group, Getting Started, teaches you the bare essentials for Android
    app development. If you're a new Android app developer, you should complete
    each of these classes in order."
