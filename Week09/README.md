# Week 9

## Beginner 

(From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort">Wikipedia</a>) You'll be developing a sorting algorithm that doesn't do much actual sorting; that is, every time you rearrange the items in a list, you'll be rearranging them into a <em>random order</em>. If that sounds crazy, it's because it is (think of it like ordering a deck of cards by shuffling it repeatedly). Develop a bogosort algorithm that acts on some list type and test it on increasingly large lists—see how long bogosort takes to slow to a crawl.

## Advanced

In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:
1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p and £1 (100p).

It is possible to make £1 in the following way:
1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p

How many different ways can £1 be made using any number of coins?
