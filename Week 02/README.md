#Week 2
##Beginner
(From <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/1kphtf/081313_challenge_136_easy_student_management/">/r/DailyProgrammer</a>) You are a computer science professor at South Harmon Institute of Technology, and are in dire need of automatic grading! The good news is you have all of your student's assignments in an easy-to-read format, making automation easy!

You will be given a list of unique student names, and then a list of their assignment grades. All assignments are based on 20 points and are scored in whole-numbers (integers). All students have received the same number of assignments, so you don't have to worry about managing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliffe_vector">jagged arrays</a>.

(Note, it says arrays there, but there should be a way to do it without arrays if you haven't covered them yet in a class if you're clever with your loops and outputs.)

##Advanced
Did you get tired of simplifying Boolean Algebra expressions by hand for Dr. Minden? Me too. Deduce the formal grammar for Boolean Algebra and write a program that can do your homework, that is, take a well-formed Boolean expression and simplify it as far as can be done. So if we have:

    A`B`C + AB`C + ABC + ABC`
    B`C + AB

Define your grammar using any symbols you'd like for unary and binary operators. If you find it necessary, feel free to use other symbols, such as parens for separating expressions clearly.
