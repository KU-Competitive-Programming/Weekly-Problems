# Test

This is a test directory to allow new users to try out git features. Go ahead and upload something here if you want to get familiar wit the basic commands.

Always remember to commit your changes with descriptive messages, e.g.,

```
git commit -m "Fix output bug, tidy up comments"
```

When you've committed all of the changes you want to make, push them with `git push`.
