# Week 7

### Beginner
(From <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/schtf/4162012_challenge_40_easy/">/r/dailyprogrammer</a>) Print the numbers from 1 to 1000 without using any loop or conditional statements. Donâ€™t just write the printf() or cout statement 1000 times. Be creative and try to find the most efficient way!

### Advanced
(From <a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~hquamen/303/problems.html">Prof. Harvey Quamen of the University of Alberta</a>)  Look at the section "Estimating Pi." Basically, you'll devise a program that roughly calculates the value of pi using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm">Monte Carlo algorithm</a> (i.e., one that uses randomized data to to generate a specific result). Even though the website says "Perl Programming Problems," feel free to use any language of your choice.
