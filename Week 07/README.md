# Week 7

### Beginner
(From <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/w4ma2/762012_challenge_73_intermediate/">/r/DailyProgrammer</a>): Write a program that, given an ASCII binary matrix of 0's and 1's like this:

    0000000000000000
    0000000000000000
    0000011001110000
    0000001111010000
    0000011001110000
    0000011011100000
    0000000000110000
    0000101000010000
    0000000000000000
    0000000000000000
    0000000000000000

Outputs the smallest cropped sub-matrix that still contains all 1's (that is, remove all borders of 0's):

    01100111
    00111101
    01100111
    01101110
    00000011
    10100001

### Advanced
(Adapted from <a href="http://openbookproject.net/pybiblio/practice/elkner/literaryanalysis.php">here</a>): Your English teacher has just asked you to write a paper analyzing a classic work of literature. Since you are an amazing programmer, you decide to put your skills to use. You plan to create a computer-generated report of the vocabulary used in your favorite literary classic.

Your objective is to write a program that will take a text file as input and return a report listing alphabetically all the words in the file and the number of occurrences of each. An example text (Lewis Carroll's <em>Through the Looking-Glass</em>) can be found <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/12/pg12.txt">here</a>.
